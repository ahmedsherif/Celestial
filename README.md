# Splisher

I am building this __Micropub client__ with a few goals in mind:

- Be as spec-compliant as possible.
- Look good and support system-based dark mode.
- Make self-hosting as easy as configuring environment variables followed by `docker-compose up`.
- Make IndieWeb accessible to less technically inclined folks.
- To make something useful for myself and others while I figure out and learn backend content.

Although spec compliance should ensure it works with any Micropub server, I will only be testing this with [Indiekit](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit/ "indiekit"). Paul Robert Lloyd is currently working on its successor [here](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit-redux "indiekit-redux").

## To-Do

- [x] Set up infrastructure with a welcome page
- [ ] IndieAuth spec compliance
    - [ ] Authorization
        - [x] Basic usage with a sample `create` scope
        - [ ] Complete all requirements as laid out by the spec
- [ ] Micropub spec compliance
    - [ ] [Query server for configuration](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#configuration)
    - [ ] [Syndication targets](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#syndication-targets)
- [ ] General resilience tasks
    - [ ] Use a logging library like `winston`
        - [ ] Set up with a transport such as [timber.io](https://timber.io)

## Usage

__Not ready for public use.__

* `git clone git@github.com:hirusi/splisher.git`
* `heroku apps:create [name]`
* `git push heroku master`

## Local Development

The Dockerfile is designed to only run on Linux hosts -- it uses a bind mount.

* `git clone git@github.com:hirusi/splisher.git && cd splisher`
* `docker-compose build`
* `nvm use && npm install` - Install packages locally for now. This will not be required in the future, if and when I figure out how `node_modules` need to work in a Docker environment. PRs welcome.
* `docker-compose up`
* ~~`docker container exec splisher_web_1 npm install`~~
