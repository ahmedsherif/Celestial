# Splisher

I am building this __Micropub client__ with a few goals in mind:

- Be as spec-compliant as possible.
- Look good and support system-based dark mode.
- Make self-hosting as easy as configuring environment variables followed by `docker-compose up`.
- Make IndieWeb accessible to less technically inclined folks.
- To make something useful for myself and others while I figure out and learn backend content.

Although spec compliance should ensure it works with any Micropub server, I will only be testing this with [Indiekit](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit/ "indiekit"). Paul Robert Lloyd is currently working on its successor [here](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit-redux "indiekit-redux").

## Usage

__Not ready for public use.__

* `git clone git@github.com:hirusi/splisher.git`
* `heroku apps:create [name]`
* `git push heroku master`

## Local Development

The Dockerfile is designed to only run on Linux hosts -- it uses a bind mount.

* `git clone git@github.com:hirusi/splisher.git && cd splisher`
* `docker-compose build`
* `nvm use && npm install` - Install packages locally for now. This will not be required in the future, if and when I figure out how `node_modules` need to work in a Docker environment. PRs welcome.
* `docker-compose up`
* ~~`docker container exec splisher_web_1 npm install`~~
