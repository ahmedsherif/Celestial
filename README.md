# Celestial

I am building this __Micropub client__ with a few goals in mind:

- Be as spec-compliant as possible.
- Look good and support system-based dark mode.
- Make self-hosting as easy as configuring environment variables followed by `docker-compose up`.
- Make IndieWeb accessible to less technically inclined folks.
- To make something useful for myself and others while I figure out and learn backend content.

If you'd like to show me some support, please star the project. â™¥

Although spec compliance should ensure it works with any Micropub server, I will only be testing this with [Indiekit](https://github.com/getindiekit/indiekit/ "indiekit"). Paul Robert Lloyd is currently working on its successor. If you use a different Micropub server and face a problem, please open an issue and I'll see how best I can fix it.

A [demo site](https://micropub-celestial.herokuapp.com/) is available through Heroku. Currently deployed commit: [#18a882](https://github.com/hirusi/Celestial/commit/18a8826d45d8e170414b1cb434973a25867330be).

## Usage

__Not ready for public use.__

Detailed development instructions are [availble in the docs](/docs/development.md).

## Limitations of the public example server

* I have implemented a strong Content Security Policy, and only allow the browser to load images from certain specified domains. This will **not** be changed to accomodate your domain.
    * **Workaround**: If you self-host, it's easy to add a new domain to the list of allowed domains. This will nicely show your profile photo (based on microformats2) once you log in. To do this, head over to the `src/index.ts` file and change the following block to include your domain:
    ```
    // Set up a CSP
    const directives = {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/"],
        imgSrc: ["'self'", "https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/", "https://yourdomain.com"],
    };
    ```
* In the event the example server runs into excessive traffic, it will not scale. I have aimed to make self-hosting easy for exactly this reason. If you are facing any issue in doing so, please open an issue on the repository and someone should be able to help you.
