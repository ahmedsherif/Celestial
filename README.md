# Splisher

I am building this __Micropub client__ with a few goals in mind:

- Be as spec-compliant as possible.
- Look good and support system-based dark mode.
- Make self-hosting as easy as configuring environment variables followed by `docker-compose up`.
- Make IndieWeb accessible to less technically inclined folks.
- To make something useful for myself and others while I figure out and learn backend content.

Although spec compliance should ensure it works with any Micropub server, I will only be testing this with [Indiekit](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit/ "indiekit"). Paul Robert Lloyd is currently working on its successor [here](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit-redux "indiekit-redux").

## To-Do

### Until we reach v1.0

- [x] Set up infrastructure with a welcome page
- [x] IndieAuth spec compliance
    - [x] Authorization
        - [x] Basic usage with a sample `create` scope
        - [x] Complete all requirements as laid out by the spec
- [ ] Micropub spec compliance
    - [x] [Endpoint discovery](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#endpoint-discovery)
    - [ ] [Create](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#create)
        - [x] `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
        - [ ] `form/multipart`
        - [ ] `JSON`
    - [ ] [Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#create)
    - [ ] [Delete](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#create)
    - [ ] [Media endpoint](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#media-endpoint)
    - [x] [Query server for configuration](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#configuration)
    - [x] [Syndication targets](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#syndication-targets)
- [ ] General resilience tasks
    - [x] Use a logging library like `winston`
        - [ ] Set up with a transport such as [timber.io](https://timber.io)
    - [ ] Modular codebase
    - [ ] Best practices
    - [ ] [Express security checklist](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html)
    - [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] [Types of posts](https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts) to be supported:

    - [ ] ðŸ“… [Event](https://indieweb.org/event)
    - [ ] â†ª [Reply with RSVP](https://indieweb.org/rsvp)
- [ ] Micropub extensions
    - [ ] [Query for supported post types](https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Query_for_Supported_Vocabulary)
    - [ ] [Slug](https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Slug)
    - [ ] [Query for category/tag list](https://indieweb.org/Micropub-extensions#Query_for_Category.2FTag_List)
- [ ] Design
    - [ ] Consistent spacing
    - [ ] Design for more breakpoints (tablets, specifically) if the need is seen
    - [ ] Better forms UI/UX

### Moving forward to v2.0

- [ ] Rely on our own code instead of external libraries for menial tasks. Reduce dependencies and allow the project to be maintainable in the long run.
- [ ] Idea: Add an inline live Markdown preview for Article, or remove it entirely and let folks fall back on better interfaces/systems which already do this job well. Examples: Netlify CMS, Forestry.

## Usage

__Not ready for public use.__

You are encouraged to self-host this web application. While you can use the example server hosted on Heroku, you may run into some limitations.

* `git clone git@github.com:hirusi/splisher.git`
* `heroku apps:create [name]`
* `git push heroku master`

### Limitations

* We have implemented a strong Content Security Policy, and only allow the browser to load images from certain specified domains. I will **not** be changing this setting on the example server.
    * **Workaround**: If you self-host, it's easy to add a new domain to the list of allowed domains. This will nicely show your profile photo (based on microformats2) once you log in. To do this, head over to the `src/index.ts` file and change the following block to include your domain:
    ```
    // Set up a CSP
    const directives = {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/"],
        imgSrc: ["'self'", "https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/", "https://yourdomain.com"],
    };
    ```
* In the event the example server runs into excessive traffic, it will not scale. I cannot afford paying for extra server resources. I have aimed to make self-hosting easy for exactly this reason. If you are facing any issue in doing so, please open an issue on the repository and someone should be able to help you.

## Local Development

The Dockerfile is designed to only run on Linux hosts -- it uses a bind mount.

* `git clone git@github.com:hirusi/splisher.git && cd splisher`
* `docker-compose build`
* `nvm use && npm install` - Install packages locally for now. This will not be required in the future, if and when I figure out how `node_modules` need to work in a Docker environment. PRs welcome.
* `docker-compose up`
* ~~`docker container exec splisher_web_1 npm install`~~
