* [[x]] Confirmed via micropub.rocks

## Discovery
* [x] The client discovers the Micropub endpoint given the profile URL of a user (e.g. the sign-in form asks the user to enter their URL, which is used to find the Micropub endpoint)

## Authentication
* [x] The client sends the access token in the HTTP `Authorization` header.
* [ ] The client sends the access token in the post body for `x-www-form-urlencoded` requests.
* [x] The client requests one or more `scope` values when obtaining user authorization.
 * `create`

## Syntax
* [x] 100: Creates posts using `x-www-form-urlencoded` syntax.
* [ ] 200: Creates posts using JSON syntax.
* [ ] 101: Creates posts using `x-www-form-urlencoded` syntax with multiple values of the same property name (e.g. tags).
* [ ] 201: Creates posts using JSON syntax with multiple values of the same property name (e.g. tags).
* [ ] 202: Creates posts with HTML content. (JSON)
* [ ] 204: Creates posts using JSON syntax including a nested Microformats2 object.
* [ ] 300: Creates posts including a file by sending the request as `multipart/form-data` to the Micropub endpoint.

## Creating Posts
* [ ] 104: Allows creating posts with a photo referenced by URL rather than uploading the photo as a Multipart request. (form-encoded)
* [ ] 203: Allows creating posts with a photo referenced by URL rather than uploading the photo as a Multipart request. (JSON)
* [ ] 205: Allows creating posts with a photo including image alt text.
* [ ] Recognizes HTTP 201 and 202 with a `Location` header as a successful response from the Micropub endpoint.
* [ ] 105: Allows the user to specify one or more syndication endpoints from their list of endpoints discovered in the `q=config` or `q=syndicate-to` query.

## Media Endpoint
* [ ] 700: Checks to see if the Micropub endpoint specifies a Media Endpoint, and uploads photos there instead.
* [[ ]] Uses multipart requests only as a fallback when there is no Media Endpoint specified.

 * [[x]] Looks in the response for the Media Endpoint
 * [[x]] Looks in the response for syndication targets
* [ ] 601: Queries the Micropub endpoint with `q=syndicate-to`
* [ ] 602: Queries the Micropub endpoint for a post's source content without specifying a list of properties
