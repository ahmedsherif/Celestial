<p>I made this Micropub client with a few goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Be as spec-compliant as possible.</li>
    <li>Look good and support system-based dark mode. Who would be happy returning (again and again...) to something that is not pleasing to the eye? ðŸ™‚</li>
    <li>Self-hosting should be easy. Make IndieWeb accessible to less technically inclined folks.</li>
    <li>To make something useful while I figure out and learn backend content.</li>
</ul>
